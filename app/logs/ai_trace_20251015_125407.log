[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Preconditions:
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]           • Only choose send_comment_with_typing when Generated Comment Present is True and Comment Interface Open is True
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]           • If Comment Interface Open is True and Generated Comment Present is False → the next action must be "generate_comment"
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]         
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]                 
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]                 No screenshot is available. Determine the best next action.
[2025-10-15 12:54:34.538]                 Usually this should be "capture_screenshot" to see the current state.

[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         2. analyze_profile - Comprehensive analysis (automatically scrolls 3 times, extracts all user content, analyzes complete profile)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         3. scroll_profile - Manual scroll (rarely needed since analyze_profile handles scrolling)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         4. make_like_decision - Decide whether to like or dislike profile
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         5. detect_like_button - Find like button coordinates (use before execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         6. execute_like - Tap the like button (REQUIRED before commenting - opens comment interface)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         7. generate_comment - Create personalized comment (use after execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         8. send_comment_with_typing - Complete comment process (use after generate_comment, requires comment interface to be open)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         9. send_like_without_comment - Send like without typing comment (fallback)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         10. execute_dislike - Dislike/skip current profile
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         11. navigate_to_next - Move to next profile
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         12. verify_profile_change - Check if we moved to new profile
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         13. recover_from_stuck - Attempt recovery when stuck
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         14. reset_app - Force close and reopen Hinge app (use when severely stuck on or an unexpected page or different app)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         15. finalize - End the session
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Preconditions:
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]           • Only choose send_comment_with_typing when Generated Comment Present is True and Comment Interface Open is True
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]           • If Comment Interface Open is True and Generated Comment Present is False → the next action must be "generate_comment"
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]         
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]                 
[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]                 Analyze the current screenshot and determine the best next action.

[2025-10-15 12:56:00.712]                 - Are there any error conditions or stuck states?

[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - Preconditions:

[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]           • If Comment Interface Open is True and Generated Comment Present is False → the next action must be "generate_comment"

[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:56:29.366]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors

[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         Available Actions:
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         1. capture_screenshot - Take screenshot of current screen
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         2. analyze_profile - Comprehensive analysis (automatically scrolls 3 times, extracts all user content, analyzes complete profile)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         3. scroll_profile - Manual scroll (rarely needed since analyze_profile handles scrolling)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         4. make_like_decision - Decide whether to like or dislike profile
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         5. detect_like_button - Find like button coordinates (use before execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         6. execute_like - Tap the like button (REQUIRED before commenting - opens comment interface)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         7. generate_comment - Create personalized comment (use after execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         8. send_comment_with_typing - Complete comment process (use after generate_comment, requires comment interface to be open)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         9. send_like_without_comment - Send like without typing comment (fallback)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         10. execute_dislike - Dislike/skip current profile
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         11. navigate_to_next - Move to next profile
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         12. verify_profile_change - Check if we moved to new profile
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         13. recover_from_stuck - Attempt recovery when stuck
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         14. reset_app - Force close and reopen Hinge app (use when severely stuck on or an unexpected page or different app)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         15. finalize - End the session
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Preconditions:
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]           • Only choose send_comment_with_typing when Generated Comment Present is True and Comment Interface Open is True
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]           • If Comment Interface Open is True and Generated Comment Present is False → the next action must be "generate_comment"
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]         
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]                 
[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]                 Analyze the current screenshot and determine the best next action.

[2025-10-15 12:57:33.045]                 - Are there any error conditions or stuck states?

[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Preconditions:
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]           • Only choose send_comment_with_typing when Generated Comment Present is True and Comment Interface Open is True
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]           • If Comment Interface Open is True and Generated Comment Present is False → the next action must be "generate_comment"
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]

[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]                 Consider:
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]                 - What type of screen is currently displayed?
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]                 - What is the appropriate next step in the workflow?
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]                 - Are there any error conditions or stuck states?
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]                 - Has the session goal been completed?
[2025-10-15 12:58:03.153]
