[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         1. capture_screenshot - Take screenshot of current screen
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         2. analyze_profile - Comprehensive analysis (automatically scrolls 3 times, extracts all user content, analyzes complete profile)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         3. scroll_profile - Manual scroll (rarely needed since analyze_profile handles scrolling)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         4. make_like_decision - Decide whether to like or dislike profile
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         5. detect_like_button - Find like button coordinates (use before execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         6. execute_like - Tap the like button (REQUIRED before commenting - opens comment interface)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         7. generate_comment - Create personalized comment (use after execute_like)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         8. send_comment_with_typing - Complete comment process (use after generate_comment, requires comment interface to be open)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         9. send_like_without_comment - Send like without typing comment (fallback)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         10. execute_dislike - Dislike/skip current profile
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         11. navigate_to_next - Move to next profile

[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]         
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]                 
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]                 No screenshot is available. Determine the best next action.
[2025-10-15 12:34:53.277]                 Usually this should be "capture_screenshot" to see the current state.

[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:36:43.257]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors

[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:37:21.565]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors

[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         8. send_comment_with_typing - Complete comment process (use after generate_comment, requires comment interface to be open)

[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         Workflow Guidelines:
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - Always start with capture_screenshot if no current screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - The general flow is: capture_screenshot > analyze_profile (comprehensive) > make_like_decision > detect_like_button > execute_like > generate_comment > send_comment_with_typing > next profile
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - analyze_profile automatically performs 3 scrolls and extracts all user content (no need for separate scroll actions)
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - Only like profiles that meet quality criteria based on comprehensive analysis
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - IMPORTANT: Must execute_like (tap like button) BEFORE attempting to comment - comment interface only appears after like button is tapped
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - For commenting workflow: detect_like_button → execute_like → generate_comment → send_comment_with_typing
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - If commenting fails: use send_like_without_comment as fallback
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - Use recover_from_stuck when stuck count > 2
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - Use reset_app when stuck count > 4 OR when the app appears unresponsive or severely stuck
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - reset_app is a nuclear option that completely refreshes the app state - use when other recovery methods fail
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - After reset_app, you'll need to start fresh with capture_screenshot
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]         - Finalize when max profiles reached or too many errors
[2025-10-15 12:38:34.669]
